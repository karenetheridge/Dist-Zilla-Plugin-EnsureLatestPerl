Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EnsureLatestPerl - Ensure the author is releasing using the latest Perl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [EnsureLatestPerl]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for Pod::Coverage before_release

This is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that aborts the C<dzil release> process unless the latest perl is being used for
the release. "Latest" here is calculated as the latest point release in the latest stable or development Perl
lines -- for example, 5.24.1 (latest in the 5.24 series) or 5.25.12 (latest in the 5.25 series).

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

=head2 C<DZIL_ANY_PERL>

When this environment variable is true, the check is skipped.  Therefore, it is safe to keep this plugin enabled in
your plugin bundle, and you can disable it temporarily as needed for a particular release without changing any
local files.
